About
========

ZAM is an Open Source Procedural Oriented GUI/Console based Programming Language. 
It is also used for writing Dynamic Websites.
It doesnt require indentations or braces.
ZAM is an interpreted language written in Python than transpiled to pure c and then coverted into Executable.
Therefore ZAM has same is speed as of any other language written in C(which is very fast).
ZAM was written by Mohammed Zahid Wadiwale as project in his college.
Later he released newer versions of it.
ZAM is never intended for production enviroment, its just a fun language in which all the keywords and functions start from letter z.
In ZAM some really cool projects are written.
It is a great platform for small single page applications both web and GUI.

- ZAM can also render jinja2 templates with zomplexzerver which is builtin function.
- However zomplexzerver can only render a single page. 
- ZAM has another builtin server function name zerver which can handle multiple pages directorys and files but doesnt render jinja2 templates.
- But you can use jinja-js with it and use builtin function zing but will be limited interactions only.
- zing and zingr functions help it to be full gui based programming language as it uses chromium engine to render websites with it.
- So even the windows application you create will be only simple browsers running web applications in them.
- But you can even build browser inside it using iframe, js and its builtin zingr function so its fully featured GUI Language.

- ZAM can automatically differentiate between floats, integer, doubles, strings, arrays, etc
- ZAM has builtin support for boolean values and True and False.
- In ZAM you can add numbers into strings
- With ZUNC keyword you can create your functions in ZAM
